# Wrappers

The `/src/wrappers` folder contains currently helper functions that simplify and standardize the creation of authenticated Axum routes. These wrappers abstract away repetitive authentication logic, allowing you to focus on your route handlers while ensuring that authentication checks are consistently applied.

## Adding More Wrappers

To contribute additional wrappers (for roles, permissions, etc.), create a new file in the `/src/wrappers` directory and document its usage with a code example.

## Contributing

- Add new wrappers for common patterns (e.g., role-based access, request validation).
- Update existing wrappers for improved security or performance.
- Document your changes for clarity and maintainability.
